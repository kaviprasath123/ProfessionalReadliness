Project : Home Automation Development. 
Tool Used : TinkerCad.

Project Description : 

              This project deals with various sensors and actuators. “Home automation” refers to the automatic and electronic control of household features, activity, and appliances. In simple terms, it means you can easily control the utilities and features of your home via the Internet to make life more convenient and secure, and even spend less on household bills.


Domain : 

              Internet of things is the coming together of internet and physical devices in a network of unlimited possibilities using microcontrollers, arduino and raspberry pi. IOT allows for physical devices to wirelessly communicate over networks which has led to a growing number of applications for iot devices.

Sensors :

              1.Power Supply. 
              2.DC Motor. 
              3.Realy SPDT.
              4.PIR Sensor. 
              5.Light Bulb.

Controller Board : 

              1. Arduino UNO.
